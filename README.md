When you run the script you're gonna need to provide you're default gateway as an argument, here is an example :

If you don't know what is your default gateway you can use these commands :
Windows : "ipconfig /all" or "ipconfig"
Linux : "ifconfig" or "ip addr"
Then look for default gateway, then use the value you have found as the address when running the script !
